# Toadua

_Toadua_ is the/an online collaborative dictionary for the
[Toaq](http://toaq.net) constructed language. It is also currently
being remodelled to suit general usage. You can visit the current
instance at <https://toadua.uakci.pl>.

You can also use the public API exposed at
<https://toadua.uakci.pl/api> (read the [docs](docs/api.md), too).

**Please note:** Currently in the process of cleaning up, removing the
unprofessional bits, and other groundbreaking changes. Please take the
information below with a pinch of salt. Sorry.

## Installing and running

### Locally (good for dev env)

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version ≥16 (skip this step if you're using `nix` with `direnv`).
- Frontend:
  - Cd into the `frontend` directory and run `npm install` there.
  - `npm run build` will create a webpack build.
- Backend:
  - Run `npm install` in the cloned repository to get the dependencies.
  - Run `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript sources.
  - `npm run start` should now work out of the box. Navigate to http://localhost:29138/ in your browser.

### With Nix (good for verifying build correctness)

- Run `nix run . -- -d .` to build the service and run it right away.
- Run `nix build` to do a full build. You may then inspect the contents of `result/`.

## HTTP security warning

Please note that the server is set up to run on port 29138 (by
default) and serve HTTP; however, you’re not supposed to expose the
HTTP website, but rather embed it in some other webserver of your
choice which supports HTTPS (and tunnelling). I have rewriting the
code for out-of-the-box HTTPS-ness on my to-do list.
